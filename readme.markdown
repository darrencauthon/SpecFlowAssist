SpecFlowAssist
========

SpecFlowAssist is a small library that I wrote to assist me when I use SpecFlow.  SpecFlow is great the way it is, but as I used it I noticed I was doing a few things over and over.  This library contains a few extension methods and helpers that save me time and cut down the amount of code behind my specs.
