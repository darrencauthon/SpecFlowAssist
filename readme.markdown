SpecFlowAssist
========

SpecFlowAssist is a small library that I wrote to assist myself as I used SpecFlow, like a Contrib project.  It included generic getters and setters from ScenarioContext, mappers from tables to objects and sets, and comparison helpers that would compare tables against objects and sets of objects.

After sharing this library with the community, I got some positive feedback.  Included in that feedback was the gracious offer to include the helpers with SpecFlow itself.  So I'm happy to say that all of the SpecFlowAssist helpers are now available as part of the SpecFlow package under the **SpecFlow.Assist** namespace.  So if you want to use them, just download the latest version of SpecFlow and code away!

I'm going to keep this repository around for a while, but my intention is to contribute all future work directly to the SpecFlow project itself.  It's the easiest
